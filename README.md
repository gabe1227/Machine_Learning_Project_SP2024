# Machine_Learning_Project_SP2024
CS345 Machine Learning Project - Gabriel Schonacher and Miguel Rosales


# GOAL
    - Create an algorithm that will predict which teams wins in a game 
      and which team wins the 2024 NBA Championship based on efficiency (+ defense?)
    # NOTES:
    - Have SVM as baseline accuracy in predictions
    - Each step has a part done by Gabriel or Miguel

# STEP 1
    - Import + Load NBA Dataset
    - Determine what points will be used in data (efficiency and/or defense)

# STEP 2
    - Determine what makes SVM work.
        - Similar to Perceptron Algorithm
        - Linear Algebra equation for margin of error
    - Create first implementation

# STEP 3
    - Iterate
